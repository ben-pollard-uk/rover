The rules for exploration are:
 * The rover can only move in the following directions:
   * North
   * East
   * South
   * West
 * The rover cannot move over sea.
  
Map files (.map) can be imported that provide the following tiles:
 * . (0x2e)  sea location
 * : (0x3a)  unexplored land location
 * @ (0x40)  explored land location
  
Alternatively, maps can be generated from within the UI.
